# How to use the Project

There are a few top most visited city once user enters the website, and if user click on the image, it will bring user to the website with more information about that city.

The header buttons will work when the destination is searched, it will bring the user to the body.

Use the search placeholder to search for a city.

The current weather of that city will be shown after city is being searched.

Some attractions will be shown below the weather.

When an attraction is clicked, it will shown an description of that attraction.

Some top restaurants will be shown after the attrations since tourist gets hungry after visiting attractions.
